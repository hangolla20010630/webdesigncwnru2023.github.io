                                        Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, usually each with five players,
                                        compete against one another on a rectangular court with the main goal of
                                        preventing
                                        the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop while putting the ball
                                        through the defender's hoop.

                                        Basketball, a sport that has captured the hearts of millions worldwide, has a
                                        fascinating and vibrant history. In 1891, Dr. James Naismith, a visionary
                                        Canadian physical education instructor, introduced the game as a solution to
                                        keep his students active during the winter. With a soccer ball and peach baskets
                                        serving as the initial equipment, basketball quickly gained popularity and
                                        underwent significant transformations. Over the years, the sport evolved with
                                        the introduction of dribbling, the establishment of professional leagues like
                                        the NBA, and the integration of international competitions such as the Olympics.
                                        From its humble beginnings, basketball has become a global phenomenon, uniting
                                        cultures, inspiring athletes, and captivating fans with its electrifying
                                        displays of athleticism and teamwork.

                                        James Naismith was searching for a fresh activity to keep his pupils entertained
                                        while teaching physical education at a local YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts.
                                        The class couldn't go outside to exercise because of the winter. Naismith had to
                                        act quickly since he was at a crossroads and wanted to think up a game that
                                        would engage his restless and "disorderly" young men.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin-top:20px">
                                        Naismith was sitting in the gym when he thought back to his early years and
                                        recalled playing "duck on a rock" in Canada. The object of the game is to toss
                                        little rocks at a big boulder on a wall until it falls. In the gym, rugby
                                        players were honing their hand-eye coordination by tossing a ball into a box
                                        that was on the floor.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin-top:20px">
                                        Naismith thought he could invent a new sport by elevating the box and utilizing
                                        a ball rather than rocks. As he ran out of extra crates, he had to settle for
                                        peach baskets as targets and created the first set of basketball regulations in
                                        less than an hour. On that day, basketball was created.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin-top:20px">
                                        A soccer ball was used to create basketball. These spherical "association
                                        football" balls had a set of laces to cover the opening created when the other
                                        sewn-together pieces of the ball's cover were turned inside-out in order to
                                        enter the inflating bladder. These laces could make dribbling and bounce passes
                                        unpredictable. Later, a technique for making balls without laces was created,
                                        and Naismith approved of this modification to the sport.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin-top:20px">
                                        The first basketballs were brown, and Tony Hinkle didn't introduce the orange
                                        ball that is currently commonly used until the late 1950s when he was searching
                                        for a ball that would be more apparent to players and spectators alike. The
                                        original game did not have dribbling, only the "bounce pass" to teammates.
                                        Passing the ball was the main way to move the ball. When dribbling was
                                        eventually introduced, the early balls' asymmetrical design made it difficult.
                                        By 1896, dribbling was common, and in 1898, a rule banning the double dribble
                                        was put into effect.

                                        given time. The goal of the game is to outscore your opponent by shooting the
                                        ball into your basket while preventing them from doing the same. The ball can be
                                        advanced up the floor using only one's hands, either by dribbling or passing to
